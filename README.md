## :raising_hand:Hi! My name is Galia
I'm a software developer, a maker and an all around geek :space_invader:

I studied Computer Science & Mathematics in Tel Aviv University,  
and Industrial Design in HIT. I'm talented like that... :wink:

I’m looking for a job as a C++ programmer, could I be the one you're looking for?
